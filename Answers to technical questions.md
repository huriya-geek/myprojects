(1). How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
	=> First of all, Thank You for this Amazing Opportunity!!! I spent three days on coding test. I enjoyed coding for this task, it was challenging. If I had more time, I would have added some innovative animation effects to the text and images. Also, I would have worked more on its responsiveness. Due to some system issue, MySQL is not working properly on my laptop(may be due to Windows 8), so I had tried to code CRUD functionality but was not able to test it as MySQL and Xampp not working properly on my laptop. I still tried to code for CRUD functionality and added the files for you on github. You may check it here. If this issue would not have been there, I would have created fully functional CRUD Application and also would have fetched data for Front End Development. 

(2). How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
	=> There could be several reasons for performance issue in production. I would analyze the following things
	in order to track down the performance issue.
	1. Network Connectivity
	2. Server Speed and Loading Time
	3. Analyzing code (Poorly written code must be improvised if found any)
	4. Load Balancing
	5. Checking specific HTML Title tags
	6. Checking if there is Traffic Spikes
	7. I will use Google Analytics tool in order to track down performance issue in a better way.
